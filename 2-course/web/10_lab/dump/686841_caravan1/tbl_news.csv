6,2018-01-24,"<p>Hope this email finds the New Year treating you well and you sticking to any resolution you may have made. :)</p>\r\n<p><strong>Light of Day Winterfest 2018</strong> wrapped up last week and I cannot express my thanks to all the fans, artists, volunteers and sponsors who once again made Asbury Park the place to be for five days in the middle of the winter!</p>\r\n<p>The extended Winterfest started in Montclair and Philadelphia on January 5/6, a one-day event in Asbury Park on January 7, NYC on January 10, and then fans from all over the world took over Asbury from January 11th to 15th for what seemed like a never-ending amount of shows and after-hour parties! I got a chance to talk about the work of LOD on CBS2 Morning Show. Being surrounded by three beautiful women even makes me look good! Watch it here:</p>\r\n<a href=""http://newyork.cbslocal.com/video/category/spoken-word-wcbstv/3792165-preview-of-light-of-day-winterfest-in-asbury-park/"" target=""_blank""><div class=""btn"">Watch Joe on CBS2 Morning Show</div></a>\r\n<p style=""margin-top: 20px;"">That same evening at the Paramount Theater, Stone Caravan (Sam LaMonica, Greg Lykins, Jerry Scaringe and Seth Saltzman) ripped up the stage with a rocking performance (5th of that week!) and then I stepped in front of the curtain to perform a few acoustic songs and to check one off the bucket list as I sang Bruce's ""4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)"" with Rock and Roll Hall of Fame member and performer on the original recording, Vini ""Mad Dog"" Lopez. We were then joined by the wonderful Miss Emily from LOD Canada, who also joined me on TV earlier than day, for ""Hold On"". For me, both songs were very special.</p>\r\n<div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/SjwJUWr9Y0E?rel=0&showinfo=0&autoplay=0' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\r\n<p style=""margin-top: 20px;"">I have been so happy/taken aback/relieved by the early fan response to <strong>""Jersey Diner""</strong>. It's my first release in five years and I knew I liked what I heard in the studio, but you never know how songs will be received until folks tell you. We had advance copies ready for LOD Europe and LOD Winterfest. It was so great to to get it out to folks. The reaction to our last release, <strong>""Sway,""</strong> was strong as well but the messages I've been getting makes me feel, and I've been told, that this is the strongest release I've put out in 18 years since <strong>""Rock & Roll Station,""</strong> which got me into GRAMMY world back then! :) I'm already thinking about the next JD&SC record and maybe even a JD's Acoustic Excursion one as well, but until then...</p>\r\n<p>With all that being said, this coming Saturday we have two CD release shows at our longtime, legendary music cabaret <strong>The Turning Point in Piermont, NY,</strong> on the banks of the Hudson and close to Westchester and Bergen counties, but proudly part of Rockland County. Here is a link to reserve tickets as we hope to have two killer shows at 7:30 and 9:30pm. It's all ages and they serve food as well as libations for those of you who haven't been there. Visit www.turningpointcafe.com  or you can call and reserve tickets at  845-359-1089. They have also made a special ticket price for folks who want to attend both shows. Thanks, John!</p>\r\n<p><strong>""Jersey Diner""</strong> is not yet on iTunes, CDBaby, Spotify, etc. as we are hoping folks purchase ""real copies"" first from us, but eventually this record, like my past releases, will be part of the cyber world. Here is the link to get it directly from us at SCR/Schoolhouse Records <a href=""http://www.jdcaravan.com/store"" target=""_top"">www.jdcaravan.com/store</a>. Also, all past releases are on sale for a limited time for $10!</p>\r\n<a href=""store.php?id=1"" target=""_top""><div class=""btn"">Purchase Jersey Diner</div></a>\r\n<p style=""margin-top: 20px;"">Please check out <strong>JDCaravan.com</strong> as the website has a new look/overhaul. Thanks, Matt.</p>\r\n<p>Also, the lyrics for the songs (and all my other past releases) will be up on the website soon as we didn't include them in the packaging (which came out great due to the talent once again of Harry Choron). <strong>""Jersey Diner""</strong> was produced by Greg Talenfeld with assistance from yours truly and we had a great list of musicians come in and join Stone Caravan and myself. Those liner notes will also be part of the new website design soon.</p>\r\n<p>Lastly, please put June 22 to June 25 on your calendar the for 5th edition of the <strong>Rockland-Bergen Music Festival!</strong></p>\r\n<p>Thanks as always for all the support in words, presence and purchasing. It all makes me a very lucky guy...</p>\r\n<p>All my best,<br />\r\nJoe D</p>","""Jersey Diner"" CD Release Shows - Sat., Jan. 27 at 7:30 & 9:30pm - Turning Point",2018/2018-01-24/Jersey-Diner-01.jpg,"This coming Saturday we have two CD release shows at our longtime, legendary music cabaret The Turning Point in Piermont, NY.",NULL
7,2018-03-23,"<p>I apologize that it has taken me a week to ""report"" and express heartfelt BIG THANKS to everyone who came out and supported Light of Day Boca Raton and Light of Day Palm Island on March 1 and March 14. Between the two acoustic shows we raised almost $5,000 towards Parkinson's disease research and helping fund great programs like Boxing for Bob (Bob Benjamin) in New Jersey.</p>\r\n<p>Neither show could have taken place without the amazing help on Candyce Cohen and David Cohen on the West Coast of Florida with HUGE thanks to Buzz (!) and of course, Danny Zolli whose talent is only dwarfed by his goodness to help those in need. Thanks my brother! Palm\r\nIsland folks are not only party animals but beyond generous. My heart explodes with thanks to everyone who was part of a very, very special house concert. ""One for the Ages"" I heard someone yell out! :)</p>\r\n<p>On the East Coast of FL I was helped once again by the tandem on Madeleine Randi and Corey Weiner as we took over Hijinks Sports Bar and turned into a Jersey Saloon! Thanks to Eddie Jelley for the great sound (via an introduction from Tony Pallagrosi) Steve Weiss (and his folks), Wayne Belfer, and others whose names I should know! :)</p>\r\n<p>Thanks also to Neil Berg for ""donating"" plane tickets and me for this\r\nevent! :) Neil also had offered his services for the Palm Island concert but sadly his mother had an injury to her hip (she is good now!) and being the good son he is, he had to be with her and couldn't make it. Maybe next year Woody! :)</p>\r\n<p>It was good to spend time and have lunch with LOD family member Alan\r\nJackowitz while down there. If you can, please pick up his very funny and insightful book ""I'm Not Drunk, I Have Parkinson's"". I laugh and tear up almost every time I read pages from it. He also sang with Harry Chapin but that is a story you can only find out if you read his book! :)</p>\r\n<p>Next up on the Parkinson's ""front"" is Stone Caravan shows in Canada from April 12-15 in Kingston, London, Toronto and Niagara Falls with Southside Johnny & The Jukes, Miss Emily, Fennell Taylor, Jason Heath, Jason D. Federici, Bobby Mahoney and I am sure a few other kind-hearted Canucks... I think that is an oxymoron. Please check out the LOD Canada website for more info and get your tickets. I hear people flying in from Europe for the 4-day excursion! :)</p>\r\n<p>And speaking of excursions, JD's Acoustic Excursion (Gregory C Lykins, Seth Saltzman, Ken Harten, Jerry Scaringe) and myself will be taking part in a Parkinson's fundraiser in Nanuet, NY (Rockland County) on Sunday, April 22nd. Tickets just went on sale so gets yours now as there are only 140 seats available. We will be joining the most\r\nexcellent Arlon Bennett and his Healing Project for a great afternoon of music and helping with funds being raised for the Light of Day Foundation as well area Parkinson's groups. Thanks to Tom Cardullo and the Borderline Folk Club for spearheading this.</p>\r\n<p>Should have some news about Rockland-Bergen Music Festival very soon but put weekend of June 22-24 on your calendar! :)</p>\r\n<p>All my best,<br />\r\nJoe D</p>",Updates on Light of Day; JD's Acoustic Excursion in Rockland County April 22,2018/2018-03-23/Joe-DUrso-01.jpg,A heartfelt BIG THANKS to everyone who came out and supported Light of\r\nDay Boca Raton and Light of Day Palm Island on March 1 and March 14.,NULL
